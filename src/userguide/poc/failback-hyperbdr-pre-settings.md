# HyperBDR Setup

[[toc]]

## (Intranet VPN access)Test the network connectivity between the HyperBDR and the Failback Transition Host

::: tip
If the failback environment is connected to the Intranet of the production site through VPN, perform this step to test the network connectivity between the HyperBDR and the universal storage failback Transition Host.
:::

### Verification test procedure

Log in to the HyperBDR host

#### Test access to port 10729 of the Failback Transition Host

Test command:

```
ssh -v -p 10729 <Failback Transition Host Intranet IP>
```

If the input result includes the information '[debug1: Connection established.],' it indicates that the network connection is successful.

```

debug1: Connecting to 192.168.10.2 [ESXi IP Address] port 443.
debug1: Connection established.
```

## Test the connectivity from HyperBDR to the management network of vCenter/ESXi

::: tip
If your fallback environment is interconnected with the on-premises network through VPN, you can test the network connectivity from HyperBDR to the Common Storage Fallback Transition Host using the following steps.
:::

### Log in to the HyperBDR host

### Test access to the vCenter address port

::: tip
Replace the IP address of vCenter in the command with the actual IP address from the production environment.
:::

Test command:

```
ssh -v -p 443 <vCenter IP Address>
```

If the input result includes the information '[debug1: Connection established.],' it indicates that the network connection is successful.

```

debug1: Connection established.
```

### Test access to the ESXi address port

::: tip
Replace the IP address of ESXi in the command with the actual IP address from the production environment.
:::

```
ssh -v -p 443 <ESXi IP Address>
```

Test command:

If the input result includes the information '[debug1: Connection established.],' it indicates that the network connection is successful.

### Add the Failback Transition Host

**Step 1.** On the top navigation bar, select "Configuration", choose "Generic Storage" in the left menu, and click "Add" on the "Failback" - "Failback Storage Gateway" tab.

![configure-hyperbdr-host-failback-2.png](./images/configure-hyperbdr-host-failback-2.png)

**Step 2.** Follow the instructions in the form to create the Generic Storage "Failback Transition Host". Choose "Block Storage" or "Object Storage" as the Failback Method, fill in the information for the generic storage failback Transition Host, and after confirming, click "Next".

::: tip
Choose "Object Storage" or "Block Storage" based on your storage type to configure the "Failback Method".
:::
