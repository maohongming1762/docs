# **DR Site Configuration**

When the primary production site fails, the system can automatically or manually switch to a standby environment. To ensure business continuity and data availability during DR switch, you need to complete the DR platform configuration in advance.

The platform supports two types: DR and Failback, for different business scenarios:

* **DR**: When the source host fails or is unavailable, quickly switch business to the standby platform to ensure continuity and data safety.
* **Failback**: After DR is complete, smoothly migrate business back to the source platform to restore the system to its original state.

You can configure DR or failback strategies as needed to achieve end-to-end business continuity management.
