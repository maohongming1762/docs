# **Download Logs**

The "Download Logs" module is used to view and manage host log information on the platform, supporting classification by host type (such as Sync Proxy, Linux host, Windows host). Users can quickly locate target hosts using the filter function, view their log status, download log files, or view log details, making troubleshooting and system auditing easier.
