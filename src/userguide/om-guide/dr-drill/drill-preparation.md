# Drill Preparation

Disaster recovery drills are a critical step to ensure the actual availability of the DR system. It is recommended to conduct a full-process drill quarterly or at least every six months.

## Drill Objectives and Scope

* Clearly define which business systems, data types, and RPO/RTO targets the drill should cover.

* Determine the drill scenarios, such as simulating data center power outages, core network failures, or regional cloud platform outages.

## Resource Reservation

* Prepare the necessary target environment resources for the drill (cloud hosts, storage, network configurations, etc.).

* Ensure that the drill does not affect normal production operations. Use a test environment or reserved DR resources if possible.

## Notification and Approval

* Notify relevant business units, management, and O&M teams in advance to obtain the drill time window and authorization.

* Develop drill scripts and rollback plans to ensure the drill can be terminated and the original state restored in case of unexpected situations.
