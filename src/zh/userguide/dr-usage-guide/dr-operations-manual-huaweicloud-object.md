### 1.2. Disaster Recovery of VMware Virtual Machines to Huawei Cloud

#### 1.2.1. Configuring the Production Platform (VMware)

**[Note]**

- When the source  ( the host to be protected) is a VMware virtual machine, relevant configurations need to be performed.

- This scenario can achieve agentless disaster recovery, meaning that there is no need to install an agent in each VMware virtual machine to achieve non-intrusive operations.

**[Basic requirements]**

- A vCenter/ESXi cluster

- Installation of VMware vSphere Client and login to the vCenter/ESXi cluster.

- Installation of HyperBDR disaster recovery tool and the login credential.

- Enable the network policy for the VMware virtual machines on production platform to HyperBDR and the cloud synchronization gateway.

**Step 1:** Click **"Configuration"**, click on **"Production Site"** in the left menu, and than click the **""+Add""** button to add the agentless proxy component **"Hamal"** in the **VMware** tab.  

>  For the initial addition of VMware, you need to install the **"Hamal"** component (refer to Step 2).  

![hyperbdruserguide-vmwaretohuaweicloud-blockstoragemode-4.png](./images/hyperbdruserguide-vmwaretohuaweicloud-blockstoragemode-4.png)

**Step 2:** Install Hamal as per the prompts

> If you have already installed Hamal as outlined in the VMware DR Solution POC Preparation Doc, you can proceed directly to **Step 3**.

(1) Download the OVA to the VMware end or prepare a CentOS7.x version virtual machine at the source end.

(2) Install the agent by executing the installation command in the background of the host imported through OVA or the prepared CentOS7.x virtual machine.

Note: Please operate according to the current display information on the disaster recovery tool. This action is performed by the user in the VMware vSphere Client environment

(3) After installation, return to the disaster recovery tool and click on the **"Next"** button.

## 5. Host Group Disaster Recovery

Host group disaster recovery is mainly applicable to groups of disaster recovery host resources with similar attributes and requirements. These groups can be based on business units or other dimensions of resource sets. All operational configurations are done at the host group level. This includes setting up host group synchronization strategies, where all disaster recovery host data synchronization commands within the group are issued simultaneously to ensure that all host data in the host group remains consistent at the underlying level.

> When adding a disaster recovery host to host group disaster recovery, it is necessary to ensure that the single host disaster recovery configuration is completed before it can be added to the disaster recovery host group. Otherwise, it cannot be directly added to the host group disaster recovery.

### 5.1 Create Host Group

Go to the "Group DR" on the left menu bar and then click the "+Add" button:

![hyperbdr-user-guide-vmware-to-huawei-cloud-object-storage-mode-43.png](./images/hyperbdr-user-guide-vmware-to-huawei-cloud-object-storage-mode-43.png)

**Step1: Basic Info**

### 5.3. Delete Host Group

Go to [Group DR] and click the on âDelete Host groupâ button :
Check the resource group, and click the "Delete Resource Group" button to perform the operation of deleting the resource group.

![hyperbdr-user-guide-vmware-to-huawei-cloud-object-storage-mode-55.png](./images/hyperbdr-user-guide-vmware-to-huawei-cloud-object-storage-mode-55.png)

According to the prompt for host group deletion, select the relevant configuration options, enter the character **"Yes"** to confirm deletion, then click the [Submit] button to complete deletion.
::: tip
**Notes:**  
**1:** This operation only deletes the host group, and the resources in the host group will be retained. The disaster recovery hosts in the host group will still be displayed separately in the host disaster recovery, and the disaster recovery operation can still be performed on a single disaster recovery host, and the data that has been synchronized will not be cleared from the disaster recovery platform.  
**2:** This operation not only deletes the host group, but also the resources in the host group. The disaster recovery hosts in the host group will be directly cleared from the disaster recovery platform, and all synchronized data will be cleared.  
**3:** (Not recommended) I confirm that I want to force clean up resources, which may cause residual resources (only used when cleaning fails). [Use in special scenarios only such as disaster recovery hosts in the host group lose contact or cleaning fails. This option will directly clear the records without initiating a call request.]

### 5.6. Host Group - Clean Up Validation Resources

Check the resource group that needs to clean up and verify resources, click the "Action" button, and select the "Clean Up Validation Resources" button.

> This operation means that the disaster recovery hosts in the host group that have already performed disaster recovery drill / takeover and the disaster recovery host instances generated on the disaster recovery platform will be deleted. This action prevents the risk of manual operation of deleting instances on the disaster recovery platform.

::: warning
Note: If the disaster recovery host restored on the disaster recovery platform has taken over the business, **do not** perform this operation, as this operation will directly delete the instances generated on the disaster recovery platform.
